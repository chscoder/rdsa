## How to read research paper?

There are two ways to read a paper: 

Goal 1: to understand conceptually what was done usually to use the result (rely heavily on trust)

Goal 2: to understand research so deeply you can reproduce the results (0 trust)


Step 1: Get external context 
Step 2: First read - Internal Context 
Step 3: First read - fill external gap 
Step 4: Second read - Conceptual Understading 
Step 5: Second read - code deep dive 
Step 6: Second read - Methodology and result slow walk 
Step 7: Third read - weird spot identification.
